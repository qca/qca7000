       GNU's Autoconf is a tool for configuring source code and Makefiles.
       Using Autoconf, programmers can create portable and configurable
       packages, since the person building the package is allowed to specify
       various configuration options.

       You should install Autoconf if you are developing software and you
       would like to use it to create shell scripts that will configure your
       source code packages. If you are installing Autoconf, you will also
       need to install the GNU m4 package.

       Note that the Autoconf package is not required for the end-user who
       may be configuring software with an Autoconf-generated script;
       Autoconf is only required for the generation of the scripts, not their

       You should install Automake if you are developing software and would
       like to use its ability to automatically generate GNU standard
       Makefiles. If you install Automake, you will also need to install

       parse that grammar. Bison can be used to develop a wide range of
       language parsers, from ones used in simple desk calculators to complex
       programming languages. Bison is upwardly compatible with Yacc, so any
       correctly written Yacc grammar should work with Bison without any
       changes. If you know Yacc, you should not have any trouble using
       Bison. You do need to be proficient in C programming to be able
       to use Bison. Bison is only needed on systems that are used for
       development.

       If your system will be used for C development, you should install

      automatic directory generation, and automatic file gunzipping.
      The primary design goals of Boa are speed and security. Security,
      in the sense of "can't be subverted by a malicious user," not "fine
      grained access control and encrypted communications". Boa is not

        tool conntrack provides a full featured interface that is
        intended to replace the old /proc/net/ip_conntrack interface.
        Using conntrack, you can view and manage the in-kernel

        other hand, conntrackd covers the specific aspects of
        stateful firewalls to enable highly available scenarios,

        libnfnetlink and a kernel that features the
        netnetlink_conntrack subsystem. For officially

      Groff is a document formatting system. Groff takes standard text and
      formatting commands as input and produces formatted output. The
      created documents can be shown on a display or printed on a printer.
      Groff's formatting commands allow you to specify font type and size,
      bold type, italic type, the number and size of columns on a page, and
      more.

      Groff can also be used to format man pages. If you are going to use
      groff with the X Window System, you will also need to install the
      groff-gxditview package.

      The portmapper program is a security tool that prevents theft of NIS
      (YP), NFS, and other sensitive information via the portmapper. A
      portmapper manages RPC connections, which are used by protocols like
      NFS and NIS.

      The portmap package should be installed on any machine which acts as a
      server for protocols using RPC.

      organization over a modem and phone line.

      The procinfo command gets system data from the /proc directory
      (the kernel filesystem), formats it and displays it on standard

      The procps package contains a set of system utilities that provide
      system information. Procps includes ps, free, skill, snice, tload,
      top, uptime, vmstat, w, and watch. The ps command displays a snapshot
      of running processes. The top command provides a repetitive update of
      the statuses of running processes. The free command displays the
      amounts of free and used memory on your system. The skill command
      sends a terminate command (or another specified signal) to a specified
      set of processes. The snice command is used to change the scheduling
      priority of specified processes. The tload command prints a graph of
      the current system load average to a specified tty. The uptime command
      displays the current time, how long the system has been running, how
      many users are logged on, and system load averages for the past one,
      five, and fifteen minutes. The w command displays a list of the users
      who are currently logged on and what they are running. The watch
      program watches a running program. The vmstat command displays virtual
      memory statistics about processes, memory, paging, block I/O, traps,
      and CPU activity.

      structure of all of the running processes on your system. The killall
      command sends a specified signal (SIGTERM if nothing is specified) to
      processes identified by name. The fuser command identifies the PIDs of

    phase).

    It is meant to be a small - and simple - library.  Scanty and meager,
    and partly because of that easy to use.  It has one mission in life:
    create a semantic parse tree for some arbitrary user for further
    analysis.  It's not a tokenizer, nor is it some generic context-free
    parser.  In fact, context (semantics) is what it's all about - figuring
    out not just what the grouping of tokens are, but what the _types_ are
